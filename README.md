## A brief introduction to binder

binder (publicly hosted at [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org)) uses
repo2docker to build a docker image based on the files and
configuration specified in a given github repo, and then launches one
or more copies of that image in a container on Google Cloud. After
launch of the container, the launching browser is redirected to either
a Jupyter Notebook or something in the R world (see
[binder-examples/r](https://github.com/binder-examples/r)).
